**BDD CUCUMBER FRAMEWORK**

**JAVA-SELENIUM-CUCUMBER-TESTNG**

Developed an automated testing framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber (BDD), and TestNG, with integration to Jenkins for CI/CD. 
Implemented Extent Spark Reporting for comprehensive HTML test reports and enabled JSON report generation for structured analysis. 
The framework supports scalable, behavior-driven testing and automated, continuous execution and reporting across multiple browsers.

**Report's**

Once the test case runs, the framework captures the execution status (pass/fail/skip) of each test, logs detailed results, and generates comprehensive reports for easy analysis and tracking of test coverage and defects.

Extent Spark Report
This framework utilizes Extent Spark Report to generate visually appealing, detailed HTML reports that capture each test caseâ€™s execution status, steps, logs, and screenshots.
