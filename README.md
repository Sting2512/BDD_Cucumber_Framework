**BDD CUCUMBER FRAMEWORK**

**JAVA-SELENIUM-CUCUMBER-TESTNG**

Developed an automated testing framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber (BDD), and TestNG, with integration to Jenkins for CI/CD. 
Implemented Extent Spark Reporting for comprehensive HTML test reports and enabled JSON report generation for structured analysis. 
The framework supports scalable, behavior-driven testing and automated, continuous execution and reporting across multiple browsers.

**INSTALLATION & PREREQUISITIES** (Software and Plugins)

1.JDK (JDK-23 or latest version)

2.Eclipse IDE or Supported IDE(your choice) 

3.Selenium

4.Maven

5.Cucumber

6.TestNG

7.Jenkins (if you want to run CI/CD pipeline)

**Framework Setup**
To setup the framework you can either clone the repository or download the zip file and set it up in your local workspace.

**Project Structure Overview** (Eclipse)
The project is organized as a Maven-based Java automation framework integrating Selenium, Cucumber, and TestNG for behavior-driven development and test execution.

**Report's**

Once the test case runs, the framework captures the execution status (pass/fail/skip) of each test, logs detailed results, and generates comprehensive reports for easy analysis and tracking of test coverage and defects.

Extent Spark Report
This framework utilizes Extent Spark Report to generate visually appealing, detailed HTML reports that capture each test caseâ€™s execution status, steps, logs, and screenshots.

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Automation using Cucumber with Java and the Page Object Model (POM)**

This approach combines the collaborative and user-focused methodology of BDD, implemented through Cucumber, with the maintainable and scalable design advantages of the Page Object Model pattern in Java.

src/test/java: Houses step definition classes, test runner classes, page object and utils that bind Cucumber feature files to executable automation code.

src/test/java/cucumberOptions: This package contains runner classes responsible for executing test cases. It includes support for parallel test execution through specialized methods that enable tests to run simultaneously, reducing total execution time. This package also houses a failed test runner class that reruns only the failed test cases from the previous execution, ensuring efficient retesting and quicker feedback.

src/test/java/features: all the cucumber features files (files .feature ext) goes here.

src/test/java/pageObject: all the page object class for step definition goes here.

src/test/java/stepDefinition: all the step definitiont class for feature files goes here.

src/test/java/utilis: all the utility class like browser invocation, Hooks, generic utils goes here.

src/test/resources: To store property files that define global configurations, environment variables, or other essential parameters needed during test execution.

Target folder: Default directory where test execution reports are saved, including the generated HTML, JSON, and Spark reports, allowing easy access to detailed test results immediately after the test run.

test-output: This is a custom folder where reports generated by the Extent Spark Reporter are stored, using a naming convention to differentiate and organize multiple test execution results.

pom.xml: Maven build file managing project dependencies such as Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, TestNG, and reporting libraries (Extent Reports).

**Run test case through Maven command**

Go to the CMD prompt by typing CMD in search bar or win + r then type cmd
use cd command to go to the project directory 

mvn test (it run all the test case on local browser)
or
mvn test "-Dbrowser=browsername" (provide specific browser name where you want to run test case and that browser availble in project)

mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @YourTag" (it run the specific test case the tag we provide)
or
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="path/to/featurefile.feature" (provide path to specific feature file)

**Run test case through Jenkins**

Select the parameter browser and tags you want to run
Then click on build to run the test cases
